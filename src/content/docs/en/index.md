NexMaker-Fab
We have online guidebook www.nexmaker.com and offline lab in NexPCB，ProFabX. This lab would arrange training, hardware design, prototype making,project test,etc. We would try to push hardware innovation in our community one by one. In the meantime,We reference Fablab to build our lab. Now we test beta version in our lab. We would open after test the function Nov 30,2022,Bob success become Fab Lab instructor and Fab Lab Ningbo-NexMaker become Fab Academy 2023 node,so we would launch Fab Academy 2023 with the help of some friends.

It's cool if you can give us any advice. We would update the lab one by one. Thank you for your kindly support. Bob wu who graduate from fablab 2018would support the fab according to Fab Lab and real need.

This website contains lecture materials, cases and examples that will be further used for the practical teaching project of new automobile cab design based on human factor engineering (基于人因工程学的新型汽车驾驶室工业设计实践教学项目) . The project is funded by “The First Batch of 2021 MOE of PRC Industry-University Collaborative Education Program (Program No.202101042006, Kingfar-CES “Human Factors and Ergonomics” Program, details see in link.
