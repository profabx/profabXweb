Polyoxymethylene (POM) is a linear polymer with no side chains, high density and high crystallinity. According to the different chemical structures in its molecular chain, it can be divided into homopolyoxymethylene and copolymer polyoxymethylene. The important difference between the two is that homopolyoxymethylene has high density, crystallinity and melting point, but poor thermal stability, narrow processing temperature range (about 10°C), and slightly low acid-base stability; while copolymer polyoxymethylene has low density, crystallinity, melting point and strength, but good thermal stability, not easy to decompose, wide processing temperature range (about 50°C), and good acid-base stability. It is an engineering plastic with excellent comprehensive properties. It has good physical, mechanical and chemical properties, especially excellent friction resistance. Commonly known as Saigang or Duogang, it is the third largest general engineering plastic. It is suitable for making wear-reducing and wear-resistant parts, transmission parts, as well as chemical, instrumentation and other parts.

# Processing method
* Injection molding: This is the most common processing method, suitable for manufacturing various complex-shaped parts. The steps of the injection molding process include raw material pretreatment, injection molding machine operation settings, etc.
* CNC: The low friction characteristics of POM make it suitable for high-precision rotating parts, such as automotive bushings, bearings and gears, which can be processed by a variety of CNC processing technologies, including CNC milling, CNC drilling, and CNC turning.
# Post-processing
* Sandblasting: The surface of POM products is polished by spraying quartz sand or other abrasives at high speed to remove burrs, bubbles, grease and other impurities on the surface, while increasing the surface roughness and improving the adhesion of the coating.
* Painting: The painting treatment of POM materials can effectively enhance the adhesion of the coating and improve the appearance quality of the product.
* Electroplating: The purpose of plastic electroplating is to cover the plastic surface with metal, which not only increases the beauty, but also compensates for the shortcomings of plastic and gives it the properties of metal. The plastic electroplating process includes the main processes of coating polymer coating, activation, spraying and electroplating
