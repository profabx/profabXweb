Glass is an amorphous inorganic non-metallic material, mainly made of a variety of inorganic minerals such as quartz sand, borax, etc., and its main components are silicon dioxide and other oxides. ‌The chemical composition of ordinary glass includes Na2SiO3, CaSiO3, SiO2 or Na2O·CaO·6SiO2, which is an amorphous solid with irregular structure. Glass is widely used in buildings for windproofing and light transmission. In addition, glass can also be mixed with metal oxides or salts to show color as needed, or made into tempered glass through physical and chemical methods.

# Processing method
* CNC: Use diamond or carbide tools to cut glass in straight or curved lines. In modern technology, numerical control machines (CNC) are often used for precise cutting. CNC fine-engraving glass uses the groove of the fine-engraving machine's grinding wheel to grind the rough glass and remove the excess; and the glass raw material is chamfered and drilled through the drill.
* 3D printing: Glass 3D printing usually involves the use of a special 3D printer that can process glass materials or glass precursor materials. These printers usually use a technology called "stereolithography" (SLA) or digital light processing (DLP) to build three-dimensional objects by curing photosensitive resin layer by layer.

# Post-processing
* Grinding and polishing: Add polishing powder, and grind the glass raw material to the required thickness and polish it to a mirror effect on the surface by making complex relative movements between the grinding tool and the processing surface under a certain pressure.
* Glass cleaning: The cleaning process period of different processing companies is different. Generally, cleaning is required after edge grinding, and then grinding and polishing is performed again. Generally, ultrasonic cleaning + Hongdawei glass cleaning agent is used.
* Hot bending process: Hot bending process is one of the most core processes in the 3D glass process, and it is also one of the difficulties. The glass with finely carved shapes and holes is placed in a graphite mold, and then the mold is placed in a hot bending machine. After preheating, pressing, and cooling, the glass is formed into curved glass in the mold.
* Double-sided polishing: After the glass is hot-bent, the surface of the product must be polished. A cashmere wheel is used to finely polish the surface of the glass product to achieve transparency and flawlessness.
* UV transfer: UV transfer is commonly known as adding textures, transferring textures or digital images to the glass explosion-proof film (generally PET material), and there is no pixel loss during the transfer process.
* 11. Coating (PVD): The purpose of coating is to prevent fingerprints and oil stains from adhering and being easy to wipe off. The surface is smooth, comfortable to the touch, not easy to scratch, and increases the wear resistance of the glass surface.
* 12. Silk screen printing, spraying or exposure development: Make a screen for the product LOGO characters, adjust the ink, and use a positioning fixture to print the characters on the concave surface of the product.
