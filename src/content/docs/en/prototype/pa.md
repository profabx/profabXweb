PA is the abbreviation of Polyamide, commonly known as Nylon, which is a synthetic polymer material. ‌It is widely used in fibers, engineering plastics and many other fields. Polyamide is a resin first developed by DuPont in the United States, mainly used for fibers, and was industrialized in 1939. The manufacturing process of polyamide involves extracting ethane and propane from petroleum and natural gas, then forming resin polymers through cracking and catalyst action, and finally making plastic products. This material is widely used in various industries and daily necessities due to its excellent performance. ‌

## Processing method
### Injection molding
‌PA injection molding material has a high softening point and heat resistance, and can be used for a long time at 150℃. The heat deformation temperature of glass fiber reinforced nylon 66 can reach more than 250℃‌. PA injection molding materials have a smooth surface, low friction coefficient, good wear resistance, and are suitable for use as movable mechanical parts. They are self-lubricating and low-noise. PA materials have good fluidity and are easy to form, but the melting temperature range is narrow and the thermal stability in the molten state is poor. Decomposition will occur when the melting temperature exceeds 300°C and the retention time exceeds 30 minutes. In addition, PA materials have strong hygroscopicity and must be preheated and dried before injection molding. The water content must not exceed 0.3%.
### 3D printing
* Nylon and polyamide-based composite materials are most suitable for powder bed 3D printing technologies such as selective laser sintering (SLS) and multi-jet fusion (MJF).
* PA12 is the most common 3D printing material with good mechanical properties and electrical insulation. It is widely used in pipes, housings, complex assemblies, connectors and other parts.
### CNC
* PA materials use high-speed cutting tools to reduce cutting force and temperature and improve processing efficiency. Parameters need to be selected and adjusted according to factors such as the characteristics of the workpiece material, the number of cutting edges, cutting fluid, and cutting speed.
* To avoid moisture during processing, PA plastic needs to be dried. At the same time, control the room temperature and humidity to avoid moisture absorption by the workpiece, which will cause unstable processing quality.
## Post-processing
* Sanding and smoothing: Physical sanding can remove layer lines on the surface of PA12 parts to form a smoother surface. This can be done manually or with the help of tools.
* Painting and coating: PA12 parts can be painted or coated to add color, improve aesthetics and provide additional protection. A variety of paints and coatings, including primers and clear coatings, are compatible with PA12.
* Dyeing: White or light gray PA12 is usually dyed to customize the color of the part. Dyeing can be done with specific dyes suitable for polyamide materials.
* Heat treatment: PA12 parts can be heat treated to improve their mechanical properties. This may involve exposing the part to high temperature for a controlled period of time.
* Electroplating: In some cases, PA12 parts can be electroplated to apply a thin metal coating to enhance their conductivity, appearance or corrosion resistance.
