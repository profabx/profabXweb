Titanium alloy is an alloy based on titanium metal and formed by adding other elements such as aluminum, vanadium, molybdenum, zirconium, etc. Titanium alloy is known for its unique combination of properties, including high strength, low density, good corrosion resistance and biocompatibility, making it an ideal material choice in many fields.
# Processing methods
* CNC: For titanium alloys, CNC machining is a common manufacturing method because the high strength and corrosion resistance of titanium alloys make it very popular in many industrial applications. CNC machine tools can process titanium alloys precisely according to the design drawings to achieve extremely high precision requirements. CNC machined titanium alloy parts usually have a good surface finish.
* 3D printing: Titanium alloy 3D printing, also known as titanium alloy additive manufacturing, is a technology that builds three-dimensional objects layer by layer. This technology is particularly suitable for designs that are complex or difficult to achieve with traditional manufacturing methods. The cost of titanium alloy powder and 3D printing equipment is high. Printed titanium alloy parts may require heat treatment and surface treatment to improve performance. Compared with some plastic materials, titanium alloy 3D printing speed may be slower. Common titanium alloy 3D printing technologies include electron beam melting (EBM), selective laser melting (SLM), and direct energy deposition (DED)
# Post-processing
* Deburring: Use hand tools, mechanical or chemical methods to remove sharp edges and burrs produced after processing.
* Heat treatment: Annealing or stress relief heat treatment is performed to reduce the internal stress generated during processing.
* Sandblasting, polishing: Improve surface finish and remove minor processing marks.
* Anodizing: Improves the corrosion resistance and wear resistance of titanium alloys, and can also be used to increase surface color.
* Coating: Apply wear-resistant, corrosion-resistant or decorative coatings such as physical vapor deposition (PVD) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) coatings.
