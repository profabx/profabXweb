Titanium is a strong metal that exhibits good resistance to atmospheric corrosion. It is an element in period 4 and group 4 of the periodic table, with an atomic number of 22. Titanium alloy is an alloy based on titanium metal and formed by adding other elements (such as aluminum, vanadium, molybdenum, zirconium, etc.). Titanium alloys are known for their unique combination of properties, including high strength, low density, good corrosion resistance and biocompatibility, making them an ideal material choice in many fields.

# Processing method
## CNC
For titanium alloys, CNC machining is a common manufacturing method because the high strength and corrosion resistance of titanium alloys make them very popular in many industrial applications. CNC machine tools can process titanium alloys accurately according to design drawings, achieving extremely high precision requirements. CNC machined titanium alloy parts usually have a better surface finish.

## 3D printing
Titanium 3D printing, also known as titanium additive manufacturing, is a technology that builds three-dimensional objects layer by layer. This technology is particularly useful for designs that are complex or difficult to achieve with traditional manufacturing methods. The cost of titanium alloy powder and 3D printing equipment is higher. Printed titanium parts may require heat treatment and surface treatments to improve performance. Compared to some plastic materials, titanium alloys may be slower to 3D print. Common titanium alloy 3D printing technologies include electron beam melting (EBM), selective laser melting (SLM), and direct energy deposition (DED).
