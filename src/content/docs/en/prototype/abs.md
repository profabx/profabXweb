ABS plastic, full name acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer, is a thermoplastic engineering plastic synthesized by copolymerization of three monomers: acrylonitrile (Acrylonitrile), butadiene (Butadiene), and styrene (Styrene). This material is known for its balanced toughness, hardness and rigidity, and is widely used in many fields such as automobiles, electronic appliances, office equipment and communication equipment.

## Material properties
* High strength: ABS plastic has excellent mechanical properties, including high strength.
* Good toughness: It can absorb impact without breaking, showing good toughness.
* Easy to process: ABS plastic is easy to process by injection molding, machining and 3D printing.
* Beautiful appearance: The surface of the product is smooth and has a good appearance.
## Application fields
* Automotive industry: ABS plastics are used to manufacture dashboards, body panels, interior trim panels, steering wheels, sound insulation panels, door locks, bumpers and ventilation ducts, etc.
* Electronic appliances: ABS plastics are often used to manufacture housings and components in products such as refrigerators, televisions, washing machines, air conditioners, computers and copiers.
* Office equipment: printer housings, copier housings, scanner housings, keyboards, mice, etc.

## Processing characteristics
* Melting temperature: The melting temperature range of ABS plastics is approximately 190 to 240°C.
* Thermal decomposition temperature: The thermal decomposition temperature is greater than 250°C, indicating that ABS has good thermal stability during processing.
* Amorphous polymer: Since ABS is an amorphous polymer, it has no obvious melting point and maintains good performance in the temperature range above -25℃.
* Dimensional stability: ABS products have good dimensional stability and low shrinkage.
## Processing method
### Injection molding
Injection molding is one of the most commonly used processing methods for ABS materials. During the injection molding process, ABS plastic is melted at high temperature and then injected into a closed mold, and the desired shape is formed after cooling. Injection molding is suitable for the production of parts with complex shapes, such as toys, home appliance housings, automotive parts, etc. The drying conditions before injection molding are: below 75-80℃ in dry winter, drying for 2-3 hours, and 80-90℃ in rainy summer days, drying for 4-8 hours.
### CNC
ABS materials are molded by mechanical processing such as milling, turning, drilling and other methods. This method is suitable for the production of parts with precise size and surface finish requirements, such as molds, mechanical parts, etc.
### 3D printing
ABS engineering plastic is one of the main materials for 3D printing. The reason why it can become a consumable material for 3D printing is determined by its characteristics. ABS plastic has the characteristics of heat resistance, impact resistance, low temperature resistance, chemical resistance, excellent electrical properties, and stable product size.
