ABS material is a graft copolymer of acrylonitrile (Acrylonitrile), 1,3-butadiene (Butadiene), and styrene (Styrene). Its molecular formula can be written as (C8H8·C4H6·C3H3N)x, but in practice, it is often a mixture of butadiene graft copolymers and acrylonitrile-styrene copolymers, in which acrylonitrile accounts for 15% to 35%, butadiene accounts for 5% to 30%, and styrene accounts for 40% to 60%. The most common ratio for emulsion ABS is A:B:S=22:17:61, while in bulk ABS, the proportion of B is often lower, around 13%. The molding temperature for ABS plastic is 180-250°C, but it is best not to exceed 240°C to avoid decomposition of the resin.

## Processing Methods
### Injection Molding
Injection molding is one of the most commonly used processing methods for ABS materials. In the injection molding process, ABS plastic is melted at high temperatures and then injected into closed molds to form the desired shape after cooling. Injection molding is suitable for producing complex-shaped parts, such as toys, appliance casings, automotive parts, etc. The drying conditions before injection molding are: in dry winter at 75～80°C for 2～3 hours, and in rainy summer at 80～90°C for 4～8 hours.

### CNC
ABS material is shaped through mechanical processing such as milling, turning, and drilling. This method is suitable for producing parts with precise size and surface finish requirements, such as molds, mechanical parts, etc.

### 3D Printing
ABS engineering plastic is one of the main materials for 3D printing. Its ability to become a 3D printing consumable is determined by its characteristics, such as heat resistance, impact resistance, low-temperature resistance, chemical resistance, and excellent electrical performance, as well as stable product dimensions.

## Post-processing
### Sanding
Using sandpaper of different grits to sand the surface of ABS models can remove layer lines and make the surface smooth, laying the foundation for subsequent painting or other treatments.

### Surface Blasting
Polishing the surface by high-speed jet medium beads, making the product surface smooth and with a uniform matte effect.

### Painting
After sanding and primer treatment, ABS models can be painted to enhance the appearance and feel of the parts, providing a smooth surface.

### Chemical Polishing
Using acetone vapor for polishing can melt the ABS surface, thereby achieving a smooth effect.
