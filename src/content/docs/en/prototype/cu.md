# Field application
* Electrical equipment: Due to the high conductivity of copper, it is widely used in the manufacture of electrical wire, cable, electrical brush, etc.
* Building materials: copper因其美观和durability，Used as building materials，such as pipes and decoration pieces。
* Craftsmanship: Copper's malleability and corrosion resistance make it occupy one place in craftsmanship.
* Machinery manufacturing: copper alloy 因其 excellent mechanical properties, used to manufacture various mechanical parts.
* Transportation: Copper alloys are used in the manufacture of transportation tools, such as ship propellers, etc.

# processing method
 ## CNC
 CNC processing is a cutting-edge manufacturing technology that removes materials and manufactures parts by cutting. It includes milling, car cutting, and drilling. CNC processing can achieve high precision and consistent parts.
## 3D printing
Copper 3D printing is an additive manufacturing technology, it allows the construction of complex copper system parts directly from digital models. Due to the high conductivity and thermal conductivity of copper, this technology is particularly useful in the fields of electronics, heat management applications and art. Laser melting (SLM), using a high-power laser beam to selectively melt copper powder bed, layer by layer to build parts.
# after treatment
* Polishing: Use polishing wheels or polishing plaster to polish the copper surface, to obtain a smooth surface.
