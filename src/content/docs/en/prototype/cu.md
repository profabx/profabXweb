# Processing method
* CNC: CNC machining is a subtractive manufacturing technology that manufactures parts by removing material through cutting. Including milling, turning, drilling CNC machining can achieve high-precision and consistent parts.
* 3D printing: Copper 3D printing is an additive manufacturing technology that allows complex copper parts to be built directly from digital models. Due to copper's high electrical and thermal conductivity, this technique is particularly useful in electronics, thermal management applications and art.
* Direct Energy Deposition (DED): Copper powder is melted and deposited layer by layer by a concentrated heat source (such as a laser or electron beam) to build a three-dimensional object.
* Binder Jetting: Copper powder is mixed with a binder, sprayed through a print head and solidified layer by layer to form a part.
* Selective Laser Melting (SLM): A high-powered laser beam is used to selectively melt a bed of copper powder to build a part layer by layer.
# Post-processing
* Polishing: The copper surface is polished using a polishing wheel or polishing paste to obtain a smooth surface.
* Passivation: A protective film is formed on the copper surface through chemical treatment to prevent oxidation.
* Electroplating: A layer of other metals such as nickel, chromium or gold is plated on the copper surface to enhance wear resistance, corrosion resistance or improve appearance.
* Coating: A protective or decorative paint is applied to the copper surface.
* Heat Treatment: The microstructure of copper is changed through a heating and cooling process to improve its mechanical properties.
