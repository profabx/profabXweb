Polylactic acid fiber (PLA) is made from starch-containing agricultural products such as corn, wheat, and beets. After fermentation to produce lactic acid, it is made by polycondensation and melt spinning. Polylactic acid fiber is a synthetic fiber that can be planted and is easy to plant, and the waste can be naturally degraded in nature. It can be decomposed into carbon dioxide and water by microbial action in soil or seawater. When burned, it will not emit toxic gas and cause pollution. It is a sustainable ecological fiber. Its fabric has good feel and drape, is UV-resistant, has low flammability and excellent processing performance, and is suitable for various fashions, casual wear, sports goods and sanitary products, etc., and has broad application prospects.

# Processing method
## Injection molding
The most widely used processing method for PLA is to use a reciprocating screw injection machine for injection molding of PLA. The mold temperature needs to be controlled at 20-30â„ƒ to ensure a good cooling effect. PLA raw materials must be dried before injection molding, and the humidity must be controlled below 0.025%.
## 3D printing
PLA materials are widely used in 3D printing, from education to home and small creative ornaments. In the field of education, PLA is used for beginners to practice making models because of its easy printing and low temperature. PLA has good tensile strength and elongation, and is suitable for a variety of processing methods such as melt extrusion molding and injection molding, meeting the needs of different industries.
# Post-processing
* Sanding and smoothing: The surface of 3D printed PLA parts may have layer patterns, which can be smoothed by sandpapering to improve the appearance and touch.
* Chemical polishing: Surface treatment with acetone or other chemical solvents can smooth the PLA surface and improve its gloss.
* Painting and coating: In order to enhance the look and feel of PLA parts, they can be painted or coated to provide additional protection and beauty.
* Heat treatment: For PLA products that need to improve heat resistance, online heat treatment can be used to improve their heat resistance so that PLA products can withstand higher temperatures.
