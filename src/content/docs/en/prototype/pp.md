‌
‌PP material (Polypropylene, referred to as PP) is a non-toxic, odorless, tasteless semi-crystalline thermoplastic polymer with the characteristics of light weight, heat resistance and wear resistance. ‌‌PP material has a density between 0.89 and 0.92 grams per cubic centimeter, a melting point of 164 to 176°C, and an operating temperature range of -30 to 140°C. It has good insulation properties and chemical stability, and can withstand most acids, alkalis, salts and oxidants. The water absorption rate of PP material is extremely low, only 0.01%, which makes it very stable in water. In addition, PP material also has good heat resistance and mechanical properties, and is widely used in the manufacture of medical devices, building materials and fiber products. In terms of application, PP material is widely used in the manufacture of fiber products such as clothing and blankets because of its lightness, wear resistance and antibacterial properties; its good insulation properties make it an ideal material for the outer shell of household appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines, and air conditioners; at the same time, its chemical stability and heat resistance also make it widely used in medical devices and construction fields.

# Processing methods
* Injection molding: This is one of the most commonly used processing methods for PP materials and is suitable for producing parts with complex shapes. During the injection molding process, PP plastic is melted at high temperature and then injected into a closed mold, where it is cooled to form the desired shape.
* CNC: Polypropylene parts can be finished by machining and sandblasting. The surface finish after machining is smooth and may have obvious tool marks or slight surface irregularities.
* 3D printing: PP can be processed by a variety of 3D printing technologies, including fused deposition modeling (FDM), selective laser sintering (SLS), multi jet fusion (MJF), and high speed sintering (HSS)
# Post-processing
* Sandblasting: Creates a uniform matte texture on the surface of the part and can improve its overall appearance and function.
