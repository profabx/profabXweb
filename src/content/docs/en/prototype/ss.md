Steel is composed of iron and carbon. Depending on the carbon content, it can be divided into low carbon steel, medium carbon steel and high carbon steel. Steel has good weldability, plasticity, strength and toughness, making it an important material in construction, manufacturing and other fields.

# Application fields
* Construction: Steel is used in the construction of infrastructure such as bridges, buildings, high-rise buildings, stadiums and subways, and is often used to make structural components such as beams, columns and supports.
* Transportation: In the manufacture of vehicles such as cars, trains and airplanes, steel is used as the skeleton and chassis structure to provide strength and stability. Steel is also commonly used in the railway and rail transportation fields to build tracks, vehicle structures and track accessories.
* Mechanical manufacturing: Steel is used to produce shafts, gears, connecting rods, bearings and other key components. Due to its high strength and rigidity, it can withstand high loads and heavy load working environments.
# Processing method
## CNC
CNC processing can manufacture complex parts with internal flow channels, nested structures or fine features, and has higher precision and finer surface finish. CNC processing effectively reduces material waste and makes rational use of materials through subtractive methods
Stainless steel CNC processing technology has broad application prospects in aerospace, automobile manufacturing, medical implants, high-end mechanical parts and other fields.

## 3D printing
Selective laser melting (SLM): This is a commonly used stainless steel 3D printing technology that forms the final part by sintering stainless steel powder layer by layer. Stainless steel 3D printing is suitable for manufacturing parts with complex shapes, reducing manufacturing time and cost, while providing design flexibility. Subsequent heat treatment and surface treatment may be required to improve the mechanical properties and appearance of the parts.

# Post-processing method
* Polishing: Use physical or chemical methods to make the stainless steel surface achieve a mirror-like finish, improve the aesthetics and reduce the tiny surface unevenness.
