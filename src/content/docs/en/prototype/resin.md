Photosensitive resin is a resin material that can be quickly cured under the irradiation of light of a specific wavelength (usually ultraviolet light). Photosensitive resin is widely used in 3D printing technologies such as stereolithography (SLA) and digital light processing (DLP) due to its high precision and surface smoothness.

# Processing method
Stereolithography (SLA): Use ultraviolet laser to cure the resin layer by layer to build a three-dimensional object.
Digital light processing (DLP): Use a DLP projector to project the image onto the resin surface and cure it layer by layer.
Continuous droplet interface printing (CLIP): Control the oxygen in the resin to inhibit curing, so that the interface between the cured and uncured resin remains continuous.
Multi-jet printing (MJP): Use a piezoelectric nozzle to accurately spray the resin material onto the building platform and build it layer by layer.
# Post-processing
* Pick up: After the model is printed, you need to remove the model with a tool and put it in a tray for post-processing.
* Remove the support: The first step of post-processing is to remove the support structure and then put it in alcohol for cleaning.
* Cleaning: After removing the support, put the model in a storage box, add alcohol and soak it for 5 minutes, and then use a brush to clean the model. For difficult-to-clean parts, ultrasonic cleaning can be used for about 20 minutes. After cleaning, use an air pump to blow dry the model.
* Curing: After the model is cleaned and blown dry, post-curing treatment is required to ensure that the model is completely cured. Usually, the model is placed in a baking oven for about 15 minutes, and then the mold is turned over and continued to bake for about 15 minutes.
* Polishing: After curing is completed, take out the model and place it on the workbench. First, use a shovel to remove the remaining support, and then use sandpaper of different meshes to polish it, gradually increase the roughness of the model surface to obtain a better coating effect.
* Polishing: Surface treatment can improve the optical properties and surface quality of photosensitive resin by polishing.
* Surface modification treatment: It includes polishing the photosensitive resin blank to the required size, cleaning, coating the active agent, drying, measuring the size, annealing, and measuring the size after annealing. Among them, annealing treatment can effectively reduce the internal stress in the photosensitive resin blank and optimize the performance.
